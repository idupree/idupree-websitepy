Run `./setup.py develop` to create a symlink-like thing
in your python package directory to here, so that you can
include these modules in your code, and git pull and push
and edit this library code to your liking.

You may want to use a virtualenv (`virtualenv` or `pyvenv`).
It's up to you.

Outside a virtualenv, you can use `./setup.py develop --user`.
